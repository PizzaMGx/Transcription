# Transcription
This Script will upload file/s to an s3 bucket and then will transcribe them using a transcrition job for each one of them
In order to work the files in the remote folder has to be in the same extension
The bucket needs to be empty, otherwise all files in it will be transcripted 
For runing the script again the jobs needs to be renamed or new jobs will not be created 
(Important): I can add new features and solve some of this problems with a little more time and effort, let me know if you want to keep working together
